Free Wifi questions 

1 Possible: We were able to track a hacker to a restaurant 1680 S State St, Orem, UT 84097. We believe they lead the attack from free wifi. What's the wifi password 

2 Possible: We found a bus ticket for the attack taking the UTA Bus route 850. We belive they got off at Stop ID: 817265 (also could do got off at a bus stop at State St / 1700 S (NB) which would be easier)
